# Rick and Morty


The purpose of this exercise was to build an SPA, which renders a list of the characters from the famous TV show 'Rick and Morty', getting all the information from an API. It has two ways of filtering the data: by name by species (selected from a dropdown list) and by status.

By using Dynamic Routing, you can click on each character card and it takes you to a card with more details about the characters. You can also go back to the "homepage" by clicking on "return".

Shareable links: you can copy and paste the URL in your browser. If you paste the wrong URL it will give you an error message.


If you want to work with the code, you just need to download it, npm install and npm start!
